#### Software engineer - The existential context
##### Engineers are hired to create business value, not to program things:
- ###### Can you count any events where in keynote emphasizes on underlying sexy programming languages, state of the art infrastructure or code quality on their product launch?
    - ###### That doesn't mean you shouldn't use or do stuffs, but these are not the number one priority for any employer or as a matter of fact for your own product/company
- ###### Businesses manily converge on doing things which increase revenue or reduce costs
- ###### As a software engineer, adding revenue and reducing costs - those should be your only goals
- ###### Examples - multiple products v/s a simple CRUD app despite being soul-crushingly boring and of minimal technical complexity

#### Software engineer - The existential context
##### The polarity and the optimization
- ###### Profit Centers are the part of an organization that bring in the bacon: partners at law firms, sales at enterprise software companies, ‚Äúmasters of the universe‚Äù on Wall Street, etc etc...
- ###### Cost Centers are, well, everybody else
- ###### Engineers in particular are usually very highly paid Cost Centers, which sets MBA‚Äôs optimization antennae to twitching
- ###### Examples - This is what brings us wonderful ideas like outsourcing, which is ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs replace really expensive Cost Centers who do some magic which we kinda need but don‚Äôt really care about with less expensive Cost Centers in a lower wage country‚Äù
- ###### Nobody ever outsources Profit Centers (into a lesser developed market)
