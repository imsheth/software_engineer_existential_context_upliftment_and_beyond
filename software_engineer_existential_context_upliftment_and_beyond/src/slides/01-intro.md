#### Software engineer - The existential context
##### 1) Engineers are hired to create business value, not to program things:
- ###### Can you count any events where in keynote emphasizes on underlying sexy programming languages, state of the art infrastructure or code quality on their product launch?
    - ###### That doesn't mean you shouldn't use or do stuffs, but these are not the number one priority for any employer or as a matter of fact for your own product/company
- ###### Businesses manily converge on doing things which increase revenue or reduce costs
- ###### As a software engineer, adding revenue and reducing costs - those should be your only goals
- ###### Examples - multiple products v/s a simple CRUD app despite being soul-crushingly boring and of minimal technical complexity

##### 2) The polarity and the optimization:
- ###### Profit Centers are the part of an organization that bring in the bacon: partners at law firms, sales at enterprise software companies, ‚Äúmasters of the universe‚Äù on Wall Street, etc etc...
- ###### Cost Centers are, well, everybody else
- ###### Engineers in particular are usually very highly paid Cost Centers, which sets MBA‚Äôs optimization antennae to twitching
- ###### Examples - This is what brings us wonderful ideas like outsourcing, which is ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs replace really expensive Cost Centers who do some magic which we kinda need but don‚Äôt really care about with less expensive Cost Centers in a lower wage country‚Äù
- ###### Nobody ever outsources Profit Centers (into a lesser developed market)

#### Software engineer - The upliftment
##### 1) Play for longevity ‚Äî have a vision. Win the war, not the battle. Be the Iron Man!:
- ###### Arm yourself with universal knowledge so that when the rules change, when the players come and go, you‚Äôre still a viable player in the game
- ###### Frameworks and APIs change fast. Software design principles are evergreen. Learn principles that translate across language barriers
- ###### In the real world, picking up a new language just takes a few weeks of effort

#### Software engineer - The upliftment
##### 2) Get thigns done. Be the John Wick!:
- ###### "Man of focus, commitment, sheer will"
- ###### The only metric that enables you to grow professionally is getting things done
- ###### There is no correlation between years of experience and skill in programming
- ###### Break all silos and own what you build, from ideation to uptime and everything in between
