#### Software engineer - The beyond
##### Develop the SRE mindset. Being John Wick!:
- ###### DevOps = Is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality
- ###### Site reliability engineering (SRE) = Is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems. The main goals are to create scalable and highly reliable software systems
- ###### SRE and DevOps share the same foundational principles

##### Develop the SRE mindset. Being John Wick!:
- ###### SRE satisfies the DevOps pillars as follows:
    - ###### Accept failure as normal [DevOps pillar]
        - ###### SREs embrace risk
        - ###### SRE quantifies failure and availability in a prescriptive manner using Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
        - ###### SRE mandates blameless post mortems

    - ###### Reduce organizational silos [DevOps pillar]
        - ###### SRE shares ownership with developers to create shared responsibility
        - ###### SREs use the same tools that developers use, and vice versa

- ###### SRE satisfies the DevOps pillars as follows:
    - ###### Leverage tooling and automation [DevOps pillar]
        - ###### SREs have a charter to automate manual tasks (called "toil") away

##### Develop the SRE mindset. Being John Wick!:
- ###### SRE satisfies the DevOps pillars as follows:
    - ###### Measure everything [DevOps pillar]
        - ###### SRE defines prescriptive ways to measure values
        - ###### SRE fundamentally believes that systems operation is a software problem
